## Light:
### dream
Dreamy chromatic variations like you would see in pearls or opals. Seems to connotate 'sky' and 'clouds' slightly and makes beautiful sky backdrops, but may encourage skies where they would not be appropriate (ie interiors)

## Influence:
### rich-vivid-painterly
		Creates resonably finished looking scenes rendered in a more painterly studio ghibli style. Generally more textured and intricate than typica ghibli backgrounds by Kazuo Oga. Handles greenery, foliage, forests etc extremely well
